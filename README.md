## üß± GUI Layout Overview

The app interface is built with multiple `Frame`s in Tkinter:

| Frame Name             | Description                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `top_bar_frame`        | Header area with logo, animated title, and report date                    |
| `main_content_frame`   | Divides UI into left (PDF view) and right (controls)                      |
| `frame_pdf`            | Renders the PDF using canvas                                              |
| `controls_frame`       | Contains dropdowns, buttons, and error box                                |

The PDF page is rendered on a `Canvas` widget, where signatures are previewed and placed.

## üöÄ Functional Breakdown

### üìÑ PDF Loading & Rendering

- Uses `fitz` (PyMuPDF) to open the PDF and convert pages into images
- Automatically zooms to fit the canvas dimensions
- Displays first page on load

```python
pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=mat)
img = Image.frombytes("RGB", [pix.width, pix.height], pix.samples)
canvas.create_image(0, 0, anchor="nw", image=ImageTk.PhotoImage(img))

## How to Run

```bash
python portal.py
